# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## Exercises

### 1.1 - 1

> Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing convex hull.

* Sorting: browser the games with ascending prices on Steam.
* Convex hull: computing the diameter of set of points.

### 1.1 - 2

> Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

Memory efficiency and coding efficiency.

### 1.1 - 3

> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Linked-List:
* Strengths: insertion and deletion.
* Limitations: random access.

### 1.1 - 4

> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

* Similar: finding path with shortest distance.
* Different: traveling-salesman has more constrains.

### 1.1 - 5

> Come up with a real-word problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

* Best: find the GCD of two positive integer numbers.
* Approximately: find the solution of differential equations.

### 1.2 - 1

> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

### 1.2-2

> Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in $$8n^2$$ steps, while merge
sort runs in $$64nlgn$$ steps. For which values of $$n$$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?

### 1.2-3

> What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is $$00n^2$$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $$2n$$ on the same machine?

## Problems

### 1-1 Comparison of running times

> For each function $$f(n)$$ and time $$t$$ in the following table, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time $$t$$ , assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes $$f(n)$$ microseconds.
