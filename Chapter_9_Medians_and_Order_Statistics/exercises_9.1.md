## 9.1 Minimum and maximum

### 9.1-1

> Show that the second smallest of $$n$$ elements can be found with $$n +  \lceil \lg n\rceil - 2$$ comparisons in the worst case.



### 9.1-2 $$\star$$

> Prove the lower bound of $$\lceil 3n/2 \rceil - 2$$ comparisons in the worst case to find both the maximum and minimum of n numbers.
