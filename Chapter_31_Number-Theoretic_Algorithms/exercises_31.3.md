## 31.3 Modular arithmetic

### 31.3-1

> Draw the group operation tables for the groups $$(\mathbb{Z}_4, +_4)$$ and $$(\mathbb{Z}_5^*, \cdot_5)$$. Show that these groups are isomorphic by exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence $$\alpha$$ between their elements such that $$a + b \equiv c ~(\text{mod}~4)$$ if and only if $$\alpha(a) \cdot \alpha(b) \equiv \alpha(c) ~(\text{mod}~5)$$.

### 31.3-2

> List all subgroups of $$\mathbb{Z}_9$$ and of $$\mathbb{Z}_{13}^*$$.


### 31.3-3

> Prove Theorem 31.14.

### 31.3-4

> Show that if $$p$$ is prime and $$e$$ is a positive integer, then

> $$\phi(p^e) = p^{e-1}(p - 1)$$.

### 31.3-5

> Show that for any integer $$n > 1$$ and for any $$a \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$, the function $$f_a : \mathbb{Z}_n^* \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_n^*$$ defined by $$f_a(x) = ax ~\text{mod}~ n$$ is a permutation of $$\mathbb{Z}_n^*$$.
