## 19.4 Bounding the maximum degree

### 19.4-1

> Professor Pinocchio claims that the height of an $$n$$-node Fibonacci heap is $$O(\lg n)$$. Show that the professor is mistaken by exhibiting, for any positive integer $$n$$, a sequence of Fibonacci-heap operations that creates a Fibonacci heap consisting of just one tree that is a linear chain of $$n$$ nodes.

### 19.4-2

> Suppose we generalize the cascading-cut rule to cut a node $$x$$ from its parent as soon as it loses its $$k$$th child, for some integer constant $$k$$. (The rule in Section 19.3 uses $$k = 2$$.) For what values of $$k$$ is $$D(n) = O(\lg n)$$?
